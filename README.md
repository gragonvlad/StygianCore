## GREETINGS

Welcome to StygianCore. This repack is powered by AzerothCore and would not be possible without the players, developers, and communities of the World of Warcraft MMO emulator and private server scene. A big thanks to everyone for any and all contributions absorbed to make this repack possible. Your hard work is much appreciated!

<div style="font-weight: bold; color:green;">This project is, and will always be, FREE! I designed it with lots of comments and templates to make life easier for new developers and creators to get started. My hope is that all of the hard work I put into this will inspire others to get involved and create more cool and interesting projects for the WoW Emulation community.</div>

#### This repack is dedicated to the late [Michel Martin Koiter](https://web.archive.org/web/20101201092653/http://www.sonsofthestorm.com/memorial_twincruiser.html) (May 4, 1984 – March 18, 2004). His shrine in World of Warcraft served as a place of solace for myself, my guildmates, and countless others in the classic days of World of Warcraft and beyond. 

# <p align="center">![TRIBUTE TO MICHEL KOITER](https://stygianthebest.github.io/assets/img/projects/mod-michelkoiter/michel-koiter-tribute-stygianthebest.jpg "A Tribute to Michel Koiter")</p>

Michel Koiter was one of Blizzard Entertainment's premium artists and a member of [Sons of the Storm](https://web.archive.org/web/20101201092653/http://www.sonsofthestorm.com/memorial_twincruiser.html). He went by the moniker "_Twincruiser_", an artistic collaboration with his twin brother René Koiter. Just a few months before World of Warcraft's release, he died of unexpected heart failure. He was 19 years old. The cause of his death was never really understood and remains shrouded in mystery.

- I recreated [Michel Koiter](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Michel_Koiter)'s orc warrior, located at the [Shrine of the Fallen Warrior](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Michel_Koiter) in The Barrens, as closely as possible. It is said that the gear his orc has equipped is exactly as it was when he last logged out of the World of Warcraft Beta.
- A custom NPC is available in normal and ghost form.
- The Guildmaster character for the Horde is Koiter's orc warrior complete with armor and sword.
  - This specific armor he wore was unused, marked for use by NPCs, and not accessible to players.
  - I located each item in the data files _(quite the chore!)_ and updated the entries in the Item.dbc and ItemDisplayInfo.dbc to make them useable as item id 701005 thru 7010012.
  - The correct shoulders were found, but not the one-shoulder variant that Koiter's orc is wearing on the shrine. After looking at the shrine again, **_my theory_** is they removed the left shoulder of the model because it would have stuck into the shrine wall.

#### <p align="center"> _It is said that his ghost still wanders the Barrens looking for a good brawl._
</p>

#### <p align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #ff6600;">**_Rest In Peace.. See you on the other side brother._**</span></p>

## INTRODUCTION

StygianCore is World of Warcraft v3.3.5a server powered by a modified build of the AzerothCore World of Warcraft v3.3.5a server emulator. Last fall I promised to release a repack of this server for friends to host at home. Additionally, I wanted to share a fun levelling server for solo or 4-10 player groups and help others who want to exprience the nostalgia of the past and get started with development, scripting, and building their own server experience.

Included are custom tools and docs for maintaining the game database and automating archive, save, and restore operations for sandboxing, testing, and development.

### A bit of history...
In addition to new content, this repack includes updated versions of my C++ modules, SQL templates, custom tools, and client modifications from my [AzerothCore Content](https://github.com/StygianTheBest/AzerothCore-Content) release in summer 2017 which included 11 new modules and a lot of ported C++ and SQL from TrinityCore.

## ADMIN LOGIN

- **Login: admin**
- **Password: wow**

## 1) UNZIP THE STYGIANCORE REPACK ARCHIVE

**This server and tools are portable.** You can run it from any folder.

- **Recommended Repack Folder: C:\Games\WoW\StygianCore**

## 2) CONFIGURE THE SCC LAUNCHER

### StygianCoreControls.exe - Launcher and Process Monitor

![Controls](https://stygianthebest.github.io/assets/img/projects/stygiancore_controls/app_stygiancorecontrols.jpg)

Run **StygianCoreControls.exe** - This is a launch tool built for StygianCore and assists with running the processes and admin tools in the repack. It is preconfigured to run all of the server components. It offers the following features:

- A server launcher, front-end, and process monitor.
- Start/Stop/Restart World, Character, Auth, Web servers.
- Dedicated launch icons for StygianCoreTools and HeidiSQL.
- Monitors server processes (World, Auth, MySQL, Apache).

 This tool comes preconfigured to launch each process batch file, but if you want to change the process or path just click the Dragon icon to bring up the process configuration. Each process should point to the following batch files in the repack root folder:

    - WORLD - start_world.bat
    - AUTH - start_auth.bat
    - DB - start_database.bat
    - WEB - start_web.bat

### StygianCoreTools.bat - Repack Maintenance Tool

When you're ready to run an archive, backup, or restore process, click the small _Sword_ in the bottom right of the launcher to bring up the tool which performs the following tasks:

- Easy backup, restore, archive, and testing of game data.
- All backup and archive data is stored in the **Tools/Temp** folder.
- Dynamically rebuilds restoration archives for quick updates.
- Allows selective backup and restore for just auth/character or world databases.
- Auto archives any existing backups when a backup is run.
- Restores the server db and configuration to the current state of the restoration archive.
  - This is a great feature for sandbox testing.
- Has error-checking to make sure everything works as intended.

### StygianCore Tools Menu

The menu and options on this tool are dynamic and will change as you perform different tasks. The default menu looks like this:

![StygianCoreTools Menu](https://stygianthebest.github.io/assets/img/projects/stygiancore_controls/stygiancoretools_menu.jpg)

### ADDITIONAL TOOLS

I've packaged a few custom tools I use for administration of the server. Batch files are used extensively to automate many file handling and database import/export functions.

- **start_'process'.bat**

  - These are used for customizing the launch of server processes and tools and providing ways to automate tasks from the SCC launcher or SCT.
  - There's one for each major server process and a few tools.
  - The header of each file contains its original filename and a description of what function it performs in the repack.

- **start_deploy.bat**

  - Included only for reference, but makes deploying and testing new builds of each type a lot easier. Edit the paths to match your system.
  - Automates testing of different Visual Studio builds on my test server.
  - Supports Debug, RelWithDebInfo, and Release configurations.
  - Supports "Auto Start" after deploying. Great for testing build changes quickly.

- **HeidiSQL 9.5 x64 Portable**

  - An excellent free database management alternative to NaviCat.
  - Launched via a dedicated launch button ![Gold Coins](https://stygianthebest.github.io/assets/img/projects/stygiancore_controls/icons_stygiancorecontrols.jpg) in the SCC launcher or via batch in the repack root folder.
  
## 2) CONFIGURE EACH GAME CLIENT

Set your realmlist.wtf file to point to the server. For local play it should work with the default of 127.0.0.1.

- Locate and edit the WoW client file: **realmlist.wtf**
  - Ex: \<PATH TO WOW>\Data\enUS\realmlist.wtf
  - **SET REALMLIST 127.0.0.1**

> **NOTE: If you are using the StygianCore Client Pack, a batch tool called SCUpdateIP.bat is included that automates this procedure and gives you flexibility for using one client with serveral different servers.**

If you are putting the server on a different system, you will need to use that system's address.
In addition, you will need to edit the auth database _realmlist_ table to point to that system. In the example, the
server is listening for remote connections on 192.168.1.20 with a local address of 127.0.0.1. Here's a sample query to change the IP.

    INSERT INTO `stygian_auth`.`realmlist` (`id`, `name`, `address`, `localAddress`, `localSubnetMask`, `port`, `icon`, `flag`, `timezone`, `allowedSecurityLevel`, `population`, `gamebuild`) VALUES ('1', 'StygianCore', '192.168.1.20', '127.0.0.1', '255.255.255.0', '8085', '0', '0', '2', '0', '0', '12340');

## 3) UPDATE YOUR WOW CLIENT INSTALLATION

**Copy the client patch files from the repack's _ClientPatch_ folder to your client's Data folder. These files are required to support custom items, objects, and other content in the repack.**

> **_NOTE: Be sure to delete your client's cache folder after copying the new patches!_**

- ### PATCH-Z.MPQ (_REQUIRED_)

This is the client support patch required to display and enable custom content in the repack.

- Required to support custom items and content in the StygianCore repack.
- Required to enable access to forbidden zones.
- Required to enable custom textures on some custom NPCs.

**_If this patch is NOT installed:_**
  
- Custom items will appear as a **?** icon in your character's backpack.
- Custom NPCs will not display custom weapons and armor.
- Custom NPCs will not display the correct textures.
- The game client will crash when attempting to access forbidden zones.

> To complete the StygianCore experience, I suggest downloading my [World of Warcraft 3.3.5a Client Upgrade](https://rebrand.ly/stygiancore335clients) which includes [HD Player and Creature Models](https://github.com/StygianTheBest/StygianCore/blob/master/Client/Data/StygianCore%20Client%20Patch%20Info.txt), [Random Animated Login Screens](https://rebrand.ly/randomloginscreens), Custom Add-Ons and more.

### TRINITYCORE DATABASES

The MySQL server included in this repack also contains the TrinityCore databases from 2019-01-27. These are used for a TrinityCore Sandbox repack I've created for adding custom content with [Rochet's GOMove and DressNPC](http://rochet2.github.io/downloads/) tools. It shares the database server with StygianCore to make imports from core to core a breeze. You can find more info on that project at [my website](http://stygianthebest.github.io).
